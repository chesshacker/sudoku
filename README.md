# Sudoku Solver

One sunny day, my wife was working on a very difficult Sudoku problem... when
I remarked that I could write a computer program to solve it before she could
figure it out.  The race was on!

I lost the race for the first puzzle, but she started a second, so we both
continued to race... and I'm pleased to say I finished the program before
she solved her second problem.  A small conselation having lost the original
challenge.

Anyhow, this is the program I wrote.  It's not pretty, but it solves
moderately hard Sudoku problems.  I don't believe it will solve every
Sudoku problem... but with some effort it could probably be made to
do so.

This was written on Mac OS X, and compiled with make.
